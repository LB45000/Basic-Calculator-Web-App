# Math Operations Web App

This is a simple web application that allows you to perform mathematical and comparison operations using two operands. You can add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponentiate, calculate modulo, and compare values. The application provides feedback to the user, including the result and data types of the operands.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MathOperationsWebApp.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## How to Use

1. Enter numeric values in the "Previous Operand" and "Next Operand" input fields.
2. Select a mathematical or comparison operator from the dropdown list.
3. Click the "Result" button to perform the selected operation.
4. The result will be displayed, along with feedback on the specific operation and data types.

## Testing

You can test the application by entering various operands and operators to ensure it functions correctly. Test scenarios include:

- Mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, modulo).
- Comparison operations (greater than, less than, not equal to).
- Division by zero scenarios.
